                <p>Home Alone is the story of 8-year-old Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), a mischievous kid who feels largely ignored by his large extended 
                    family. He wishes his family would just disappear. He gets his wish the next morning when they mistakenly leave him behind. Meanwhile, a pair of 
                    bumbling burglars played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern take advantage of the situation by pillaging the neighborhood. It's up to Kevin to defend 
                    his home, using every prank in his well-stocked arsenal.</p>

                <p>In this dark comedy, the crotchety Willie T. Stokes (Billy Bob Thornton) and his partner (Tony Cox) reunite once a year for a holiday con. Posing 
                    as a mall Santa and his elf, they rip off shopping outlets on Christmas Eve. This year, however, Willie is falling apart. He's depressed and 
                    alcoholic, and his erratic behavior draws the suspicion of mall security (Bernie Mac). But when befriending a small boy brings out his kinder side,
                    Willie begins to wonder if there is still some hope for him.</p>

                <p>While the holiday season represents the most magical time of year, ancient European folklore warns of Krampus, a horned beast who punishes naughty

                    of the fearsome demon. As Krampus lays siege to the Engel home, mom (Toni Collette), pop (Adam Scott), sister (Stefania LaVie Owen) and brother 
                    must band together to save one another from a monstrous fate.</p>
